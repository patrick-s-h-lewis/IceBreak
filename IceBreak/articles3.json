Drawing on pragmatic theories of political and ethical judgement, this paper argues that a three-dimensional contextual approach centred on actors' reasoning process offers an innovative and reliable analytical tool for bridging the ethical gap of secret diplomacy.

Pound himself emphatically dissociated Imagism from Symbolism, which he regarded as cultivating vague semantic associations, and it is true that his poems of the early 1910s are concerned more with subjective juxtapositions of images than with their external referents\n\n\nAuthor\n            \t\t\t    \nHalmi, NA; \n                \n\n\n\n\n\n          \nJournal article\n\n          \n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\n\n"], "links": ["/objects/uuid:2a0cda75-71fb-48ed-aaf3-d6caa4b0ab68", "/objects/uuid:2a0cda75-71fb-48ed-aaf3-d6caa4b0ab68"], "authors": "CANT FIND AUTHORS"},

The method makes use of {\\it ab initio} rotational state changing cross sections calculated as a function of collision energy. Each particle in the DSMC simulations is labelled with a vector of rotational populations that evolves with time. Transfer o ...

Here an approach using a cysteine-modified 'sticky' glassy carbon electrode is presented. The electrode is immersed in a silver nanoparticle containing electrolyte and left in this suspension without an applied potential, i.e.\u00a0under open circuit condition, for a variable amount of time.

The nanodroplets are prepared from hydrophobic perfluoropentane (PFP) and coated with human serum albumin and polyethylene glycol modified N-hydrosuccinimide conjugated in dichloromethane using an oil-in-water emulsification method. The resulting nanodroplets have an average diameter of 344 nm and are stable at 37oC for several days. These p ...

An influential view, prevalent primarily due to the work of Michael Dummett, appeals to semantic features of realism such as truth, bivalence, and surface form. However, minimalist accounts enable an anti-realist to appropriate any such semantic feature. The semantic characterisation is thus unable to distinguish adequately between moral realists and mo ...
